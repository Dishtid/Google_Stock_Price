A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.  LSTMs are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies which make RNN smart at remembering things that have happened in the past and finding patterns across time to make its next guesses make sense.
